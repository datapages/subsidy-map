FINDINGS.
RECOVERY ZONE BONDS AUTHORIZED BY THE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT OF 2009 ARE AN IMPORTANT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT TOOL FOR THE STATE. ALL COUNTIES IN THE STATE AND MUNICIPALITIES IN THE STATE WITH A POPULATION OF 100,000 OR MORE HAVE RECEIVED AN ALLOCATION OF RECOVERY ZONE BOND AUTHORIZATION.

THE STATE STRONGLY ENCOURAGES COUNTIES AND MUNICIPALITIES TO ISSUE RECOVERY ZONE BONDS TO SPUR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN THE STATE. UNDER FEDERAL LAW, THE ALLOCATIONS MAY BE VOLUNTARILY WAIVED TO THE STATE FOR REALLOCATION BY THE STATE TO OTHER JURISDICTIONS AND OTHER PROJECTS IN THE STATE.

Section 25. 
Tax credit.
(a)  Subject to the conditions set forth in this Act, an applicant is entitled to a credit against payment of taxes withheld under Section 704A of the Illinois Income Tax Act for calendar years ending on or after the date that is 12 months after the date of hire of a new employee. The credit shall be allowed as a credit to an applicant for each full-time employee hired during the incentive period that results in a net increase in full-time Illinois employees, where the net increase in the employer‚Äôs full-time Illinois employees is maintained for at least 12 months.
(b)  The Department shall make credit awards under this Act to further job creation.
(c)  The credit shall be claimed for the first calendar year ending on or after the date on which the certificate is issued by the Department.
(d)  The credit shall not exceed $ 2,500 per new employee hired.
(e)  The net increase in full-time Illinois employees, measured on an annual full-time equivalent basis, shall be the total number of full-time Illinois employees of the applicant on June 30, 2011, minus the number of full-time Illinois employees employed by the employer on July 1, 2010. For purposes of the calculation, an employer that begins doing business in this State during the incentive period, as determined by the Director, shall be treated as having zero Illinois employees on July 1, 2010.
(f)  The net increase in the number of full-time Illinois employees of the applicant must be sustained continuously for at least 12 months, starting with the date of hire of a new employee during the incentive period. Eligibility for the credit does not depend on the continuous employment of any particular individual. For purposes of this subsection (f), if a new employee ceases to be employed before the completion of the 12-month period for any reason, the net increase in the number of full-time Illinois employees shall be treated as continuous if a different new employee is hired as a replacement within a reasonable time for the same position.

For the trucking industry, the window is a longer span of years immediately after a fleet purchaser receives the incentive when the vehicle is placed in service.
(2) Use market participation to increase demand for clean air vehicles through incentive programs to attain equity goals for jobs in disadvantaged communities and reward companies that respect worker rights. In so doing, the Legislature will require the state board to develop labor standards to determine eligibility for programs that provide clean air incentives for fleet purchasers of new vehicles that operate drayage and short-haul trucking in California.
(3) Maximize the environmental benefits of its investments by ensuring that recipients of fleet purchaser subsidies operate the equipment in compliance with all state laws rather than taking advantage of state incentives and then selling or otherwise transferring the equipment in question.
(4) Clarify that the state board‚Äôs authority to maximize job-related cobenefits applies to all of the incentive funds and programs that it administers.
(5) Expand upon the state board‚Äôs current approach of using multiyear incentive contracts to clearly set the conditions for attaining the state‚Äôs clean air objectives with workforce cobenefits.
